# Global University Performance Analysis (2012–2015)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global university performance using the CWUR dataset (2012–2015).  
It includes exploratory data analysis, regression, clustering, and geographic visualization.  

## Data Source
- CWUR (Center for World University Rankings)  
- CSV file included in `data/CWUR.csv`  

## Python Scripts
- `6_1_Data_Preparation.py` – Loads and cleans the dataset  
- `6_2_Exploratory_Visualization.py` – Creates scatterplots, pairplots, and correlation heatmaps  
- `6_3_Geographic_Mapping.py` – Builds choropleth map by country  
- `6_4_Regression_Analysis.py` – Linear regression to predict average score  
- `6_5_Clustering.py` – K Means clustering of universities

## Key Insights
- Higher publications and quality of education correlate with higher scores  
- Geographic analysis shows regional differences in average university scores  
- Clustering reveals tiers of universities based on performance metrics  

## Next Steps
- Explore additional metrics (e.g., faculty-student ratio, research impact)  
- Time-series analysis to see trends over years
